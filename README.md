Got it! Here's a README tailored for a Node.js project with Redis as a local dependency.

# Node.js Rate Limiting Approaches

This project demonstrates the implementation of various rate limiting strategies using **Node.js** and **Redis**:

1. **Fixed Window Rate Limiting**
2. **Sliding Window Rate Limiting**
3. **Token Bucket Rate Limiting**

These techniques control the rate at which a client can make API requests, preventing server overload and ensuring fair resource usage.

## Introduction

Rate limiting is a crucial part of API design that helps in managing traffic, preventing abuse, and ensuring fair usage across all clients. This project uses **Redis** to store rate limit counters and implement three common rate-limiting strategies.

Each approach will be demonstrated with middleware that can be plugged into any API.

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites**
   - **Node.js**: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
   - **Redis**: You will need a local Redis instance running. You can install Redis locally by following the instructions [here](https://redis.io/download).

2. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rate-limiter-nodejs.git
   cd rate-limiter-nodejs
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start Redis locally**:
   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

5. **Run the project**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Rate Limiting Approaches

### 1. Fixed Window

In the **Fixed Window** rate limiting approach, a client is allowed to make a fixed number of requests in a specified time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute). The count resets at the start of every window, regardless of when the request was made.

### 2. Sliding Window

**Sliding Window** rate limiting allows for more granular control over request rates. It uses a sliding window to track requests within a continuous timeframe, ensuring more even distribution across time periods.

### 3. Token Bucket

The **Token Bucket** approach allows a client to make a burst of requests but ensures that they don't exceed a certain rate over time. Tokens are added to a bucket at regular intervals, and a request can only be made if there are enough tokens in the bucket.
